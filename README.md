## About This Project
This is a beginner-friendly simulation of a cart management system, built using basic Python concepts like:

- Lists
- Loops
- Conditions
- Try-Except
- User Input Handling  

---

## Why I Built This
- I wanted to create a simple e-commerce-inspired project without copying from tutorials.
- The goal was to practice list operations and basic logic.
- I know this isn’t a full cart system—no product validation or pricing yet.
- For me, this was about learning to code and experimenting with ideas.

---

## How to Run
1. Save the code as `cart_management.py`.
2. Run with `python cart_management.py` in your terminal.

---

## Features (Very Basic)
|Feature|What It Does|
|-------|------------|
|Add to Cart|Adds a product name to the cart|
|Remove from Cart|Removes a specific product with check|
|Empty Cart|Clears all products with confirmation|
|Show Cart|Displays current cart contents|
|Exit|Closes the program|

## What can program do:
1. Add to Cart
2. Remove from Cart
3. Empty Cart
4. Show Cart
5. Exit

## Sample Flow
- Choose 1 → Enter "Apple" → "Apple is added to your cart successfully" [cart: ["Apple"]]
- Choose 2 → Enter "Apple" → "Apple has been removed..." [cart: []]
- Choose 3 → "yes" → "Whole cart is empty!" [cart: []]
- Choose 4 → (with "Apple") → "Below is your cart" [cart: ["Apple"]]
- Choose 5 → Exit

## Development Notes
- Uses basic Python (lists, try-except for error handling).
- Known Issues:
  - This code might have errors but works smooth

---

## NOTE
- This README is created with help from an AI chatbot.
- I kept the code raw to show my understanding and will improve it over time.

---

## Fun_Fact
- I coded this cart management system in less than a hour
